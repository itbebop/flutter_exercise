1. main에서 Join()을 처음 화면으로 띄웠을때 에러
Could not navigate to initial route.
The requested route name was: "/HomePage"
There was no corresponding route in the app, and therefore the initial route specified will be ignored and "/" will be used instead.

Since you used '/' to divide your routes it's interpreted as "sub-routes". Actually it is trying to go through these routes one after an other:
* /
* /animals
* /animals/cats
* /animals/cats/lolcats
And since /animals/cats isn't define, t is getting an error and then is coming back to initial route : /

If you want to solve this problem rename your routes with underscore like this : /animals_cats_lolcats So it won't try to get /animals/cats which doesn't exist
